One of the assumptions presented by the exercise is:

> Currently, one standing order is in force, relating to transfers from the trust to the PSMs and back depending on the amount of collateral in the PSMs.

Emilia begins her message:

> As discussed with large MKR governance holders recently, we are requesting authorization via poll for the following standing order, relating to the transfer of RWA revenues from vaults arranged by MagicRWA.

She includes a link to the standing order and we see it is 'internally consistent with some ambiguity. Covers revenue return only'

I'm noting that the new standing order covers 'revenue return only' which represents a loss of critical function relative to the previous standing order. That needs to be resolved before it is approved.

For that reason I'm holding the new standing order as an incomplete, working draft.

Emilia states:

> The existing standing order related to ALM transfers to maintain the DAI peg is invalidated as a result of this standing order. The ALM order will be replaced shortly once the new version has been fully drafted.

Her use of the present tense seems inappropriate, because the standing order authorized by the DAO isn't invalidated yet. That would require a MakerDAO Proposal.

She may have some missasumptions regarding her conversations with "large MKR governance holders" as nothing has been officially decided yet. In the end, it seems she is asking for community input in the form of a poll to help draft a single clause in the new standing order.

Faraz then replies with this:

> We approve this standing order changes for a poll today.

Bad grammar aside, I'm not sure what Faraz is approving here. It could mean signaling approval to swap the standing orders and creating a poll to that affect, and it could mean approving a poll to get feedback regarding changes to the draft standing order.

With all this in mind, my move is to make a forum post asking for clarification.

> Faraz, please clarify what you're approving. Are you saying you approve the overall plan to swap the standing order? Given that the new standing order is still incomplete (it covers revenue return only) I want to have you clarify what sort of poll you are approving before I start one.

> Also, there are too many unanswered questions for a poll to happen today. Given that this is seemingly not urgent, this will have to wait until next Monday.

> Emelia, asking for such a precise detail to come from a governance poll is unlikely to generate a meaningful result and requires a great deal of context for voters to make an informed decision. It generally works better to have a reasonable solution with rationale presented and then the DAO can signal yes or no on the change.

> I suggest you solicit feedback from the community here in the forums to help you draft the document before we take the ratification to a poll (pending signoff from Stability Scope). In any case, if a poll is needed, it will happen at earliest next Monday.

I would not create a poll at this point.
