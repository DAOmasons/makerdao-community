# Poll:Urgent - Implement Security Fix for Core Contract Exploit - August 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of a Protocol Scope Facilitator. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 7 hours beginning on Wednesday, August 9 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an approval vote to select a single winning outcome.**

- **You should select the Yes option if you approve of making the change detailed below in an upcoming emergency executive vote.**
- **You should select the No option if you do not approve of making the change detailed below in an upcoming emergency executive vote**

## Review

Technical Ecosystem Actors and Protocol Scope Facilitators have revealed the existence of a security vulnerability in a core Maker contract.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://github.com/DAOmasons/makerdao-community/blob/master/governance-exercises/poll-exercise-04.md) to help inform your position before voting.

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following action in the upcoming emergency executive vote:

- Implement a security fix that prevents a high-severity exploit immediately upon a passed executive vote and is likely to incur losses to MKR holders of approximately 20 million DAI over two weeks.

## Outcomes

**The non-'Abstain' option with the most votes is deemed the winner, if it represents a change from the status quo the following actions will be taken:**

- This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 1 hour of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active immediately.
