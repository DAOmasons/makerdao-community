# Interpretation Exercise

### Bootstrapping Governance Votes

The clauses below are part of the Governance Scope.

12.1: Bootstrapping Governance Votes
Governance Facilitators are empowered to use broad judgment when exercising their ability to make direct Atlas interpretations and edits to the Atlas and the Scope Artifacts, when this relates to unintended consequences or mistakes in the affected documents.

12.1.1: In case of unintended consequences or mistakes in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts causing WMaker Governance to function incorrectly, the Governance Facilitators can at any time run a Governance Poll to enable MKR holders to make a decision that will alleviate and resolve unintended consequences or mistakes.

12.1.2: The Governance Facilitators can at any time propose to edit any content of a Scope Artifact through a Governance Poll.

Do you think there is any ambiguity in these clauses? If so, where, and how would you rewrite the clauses to remove the ambiguity?

Yes.

'Broad judgement' is vague and could lead to varied interpretation. I imagine it's trying to say GF "is granted broad purview in making judgements"

This empowerment to broad judgement is constrained by:

> ... when exercising their ability to make direct Atlas interpretations and edits to the Atlas Scope Artifacts.

It's not clear if this ability to make interpretations and edits is being granted by this specific clause or if it has been granted elsewhere. If elsewhere then I'd add a direct reference to the source. If not, then I'd reword this to make it clear that this ability is being granted here, along with the scope and scale of this ability.

The concept of a mistake or unintended consequence is ambiguous. A mistake could be obvious or not, and range from a typo to a misconfiguration that unexpectedly takes Maker off peg. Also, without original intentions written down it would be difficult to know which consequences are unintended and which are not. This could be remedied by adding a Statement of Intent or similar at the beginning of each major section.

I think pulling in the 'universal alignment' concept will be helpful here, yet pushes much of the ambiguity into the concept of 'alignment' (But it was already there, and at least now we have it cornered.)

Rewritten:

> 12.1 Governance Facilitators are granted broad purview to make interpretations and necessary edits to the Atlas and the Scope Artifacts when addressing errors or unintended consequences.

> 12.1.1 Unintended consequences or mistakes in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts can be considered as any clause containing ambiguity, contradiction, unworkable processes, gaps in logic or any similar such deficiency that result in tangible breakdowns, stalls or general confusion for aligned actors within any governance related context, as interpreted by Governance Facilitator.

> 12.1.2 The Governance Facilitators can at any time propose aligned edits to any content of a Scope Artifact through a Governance Poll.

#### How would you interpret these clauses as-they-are in the following situations? Would you allow votes to take place? What would be the contents of these votes?

#### Situation A

> Aligned Delegates are not being compensated due to a clear typo elsewhere in the Governance Scope.

I would edit the typo to fix the compensation, and post on the forum that I've done so along with my reasoning and a reference to [Governance Scope 12](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-1-bootstrapping-governance-votes).

#### Situation B

> A large token holder wants to add logic to the Stability Scope scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle. The author claims this change is required to prevent the DAO losing significant value.

This is not remedying an unintended consequence or mistake, so I would not make the edit myself.

This doesn't sound like an emergency, so I would attempt to judge if the situation is "[Urgent](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24#MIP24c1)"

I would lean on the judgement of Stability Scope facilitators here and ask if they would explicitly deem it Urgent as defined in [MIP24c3: Emergency Response Procedure](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24#MIP24c3).  
If I determine it's urgent, I'd create a poll as quickly as makes sense, and follow that with an executive. I would try to keep things in line with the standard weekly rhythms, sensing governance burden and amount of context required for voters. I think minimizing the governance load that occurs outside of the monthly governance cycle is important, but also sometimes it needs to happen.

If it's not explicitly urgent but seems like a timely opportunity to claim value for the DAO, I'd still consider having an early executive vote if that week's governance burden seems like it could handle another vote.

#### Situation C

> An anonymous account wants to add logic to the Stability Scope scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle. The author claims this change is required to prevent the DAO losing significant value.

Same answer as above. I don't think I should treat a large token holder differently from an anon if the business case seems legitimate.

If this starts happening like spam or trolling, I'd have to have some way to screen the messages before I involve other facilitators.

#### Situation D

> As a consequence of a significant reduction in Aligned Delegate pay, all Aligned Delegates step down from the position.

If the conversation leading up to the change included acknowledgement of this risk, perhaps coupled with the intention of replacing all the AD's with others who would accept lower pay... then perhaps this is just a bumpy road toward an intended outcome.

It seems more likely that this was an unintended consequence and would consider this as Urgent or an Emergency. I'd create a poll immediately to see if token holders support reversing the reduction given the reality that we currently have no AD's.
