# DAO Masons - Poll Exercise 2

Determine what course of action you would take as a Governance Facilitator and communicate it clearly.

1. We know the information provided by Diane provides 'reasonable suspicion' that Clive's identity has been revealed. I'm assuming that 'reasonable suspicion' is equivalent to the 'significant suspicion' threshold referred to in [Governance Scope 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) that requires a FacilitatorDAO to immediately derecognize the AD.

2. According to [Governance Scope 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) I should 'immediately derecognize the AD' and could be penalized if I don't.

   The Governance Scope also assumes the existence of multiple FacilitatorDAOs who can review my decision. Since those don't currently exist, I think a good compromise is to go ahead with the poll and let Maker holders decide.

3. I would make the following forum response to the original thread:

> [Governance Scope 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) defines a policy that requires me in my role as Governance Facilitator to take action when there is 'significant suspicion' that an AD's identity has been revealed. I believe what Diane has presented represents a 'significant suspicion' and so as a Facilitator I am bound to act.

> According to [Governance Scope 2.6.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-1), FaciliatorDAO could immediately derecognize Clive as an AD. Due to the current lack of official FacilitatorDAOs described in governance to provide checks and balances, I've deemed it is more appropriate for Maker holders to make the determination in this case. In the future this decision may be made by FacilitatorDAOs unilaterally.

> I've reached out to Clive to give him a chance to make a rebuttal, and will include links to his comments in the upcoming Poll. The poll is scheduled to begin on Monday July 31st.

4. I would simultaneously reach out to Clive and let him know why I started a governance poll and ask him if he'd like to make a statement to be included in the poll.

> Hello Clive,

> I am reaching out regarding the recent allegations that your identity as an AD has been compromised. To be clear, I am following rules defined in [Governance Scope 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) that require me to take action when there is 'significant suspicion' that an AD's identity has been revealed. I believe what Diane has presented represents a 'significant suspicion' and so as a Facilitator I am bound to act.

> While FaciliatorDAO could immediately derecognize you as an AD, as authorized by [Governance Scope 2.6.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-1), it seems more appropriate for Maker holders to make the determination in this case. Please see my latest reply in the forum thread for more detail.

> As you are contesting the claims made against you, I wanted to be sure that you've had a chance to make your case and that your side of the story is heard.

> In the governance poll, I'll be linking your reply to Diane's thread. If there is anything else you would like included I recommend you reply to that thread or create your own forum post and send me the link. I intend to put the poll up in 48 hours, so please provide anything you would like included before then.

> Best,
> DAO Masons
> Interim Facilitator

4. On Monday July 31 I would generate the governance poll (see other included file)

   I've chosen to use a 50% majority poll for this poll because 50% of Maker holders signaling derecognition seems like a good signal of 'significant suspicion' to me.

5. Bounties.

   [Governance Scope 2.6.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-1) and [2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) and [2.6.3.4.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-4-2) contradict in saying that "The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty" and also "Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty" and also "The AD Buffer is used as collateral for a whistleblower bounty".

   I think a reasonable interpretation given these contradictions is to use the lower amount of "Half of the AD Buffer" as it is more specific and could still be considered using "The AD Buffer", though this ambiguity could be cleared up by an AVC. I would alert relevant AVCs to this ambiguity and remind them of [Governance Scope 2.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-5-1-aligned-voter-committee-avc-role-in-the-governance-process) and their responsibility to strengthen Alignment Artifacts.

   [Governance Scope 2.6.5.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-1) says the AD Buffer _can_ be used as a bounty and that means I have some discretion here.

   Governance Scope 2.6.5.1 also says 'GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty' and it seems GOV6 includes no such safety mechanisms. I would point out this lack to the AVCs and wait for these safety mechanisms to appear in governance before I took action on a bounty.

   My instinct is to give AVCs feedback on this experience with Clive and Diana, and to encourage a safety policy that discourages public disclosure of AD identity data. Diana's actions seem misaligned to me and incentivizing them poses potentially a greater threat than Clive's supposed compromised identity.

### Relevant Governance Scope clauses used for reasoning:

2.6.5.1

If a FacilitatorDAO finds that an AD has performed a misaligned act or breached their requirements, they can derecognize the AD and confiscate their AD Buffer. The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful data, information or evidence that led to the derecognition of the AD. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.

2.6.5.1.1

All FacilitatorDAOs must immediately review the evidence and either support the decision to derecognize the AD, or propose a vote to overturn the derecognition and penalize the FacilitatorDAO.

2.6.5.1.2

If FacilitatorDAOs fail to take action against misaligned ADs, they must be severely penalized.

2.6.6: Aligned Delegate Privacy

Aligned Delegates must keep their identity and whereabouts hidden to prevent physical risk to the Maker Ecosystem. If thereâ€™s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed, a FacilitatorDAO must immediately derecognize the AD. Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.

2.6.6.1

FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the privacy of an AD is compromised.

2.6.6.1.1

All FacilitatorDAOs must immediately either support the action or propose overturning it and penalizing the FacilitatorDAO. Failing to act is itself misalignment and results in penalties for all the FacilitatorDAOs that failed to act.

2.7.2.1

All FacilitatorDAOs always have responsibility for the Governance Scope.

2.7.6.1

All FacilitatorDAO decisions related to ordinary operations must be clearly explained and justified based on public information. FacilitatorDAOs must not claim to make decisions based on some internal knowledge or undisclosed data.

2.7.6.1.0

Generally, FacilitatorDAOs are supposed to minimally "think for themselves" and instead just faithfully follow the instructions of the Scopes and focus on the critical role of monitoring that the spirit of the Alignment Artifacts isn't violated.

2.7.6.2

FacilitatorDAOs are allowed to take unilateral action based on the Alignment Artifacts in determining whether an Alignment Conserver or other governance participants are acting misaligned and must be derecognized. If there is evidence that an Alignment Conserver needs to be derecognized, all FacilitatorDAOs are responsible for taking action.

2.7.6.2.1

FacilitatorDAOs that fail to take action against misalignment must be penalized, including failure to promptly derecognize ACs that have acted misaligned.

2.7.6.2.2

FacilitatorDAOs control one or more EGF instances and must immediately remove derecognized ACs from their instances of the EGF.

2.7.6.2.4

All the restrictions that apply to FacilitatorDAOs also apply to Facilitators. Facilitators cannot directly engage with counterparties. The only exception to this rule is in situations where Facilitators are coordinating to set up governance processes, if the interactions are clearly documented.

2.7.7.0

It is critically important that all interactions by the Facilitators are documented, so there is clear documentation that details what work is required for the governance processes to function. This reduces the risk that things will fail if a particular Facilitator becomes inactive for any reason.
